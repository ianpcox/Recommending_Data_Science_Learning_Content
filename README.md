# Recommending_Data_Science_Learning_Content
An analysis of popular (loosely-defined) data science questions posted on the popular data science platform Data Science Stack Exchange using SQL to query data directly from the Stack Exchange Data Explorer (SEDE).  The analysis employs meta-data analysis in the form of tags: 
* the frequency of their use and views, 
* pair-wise relationships between tags, and 
* ratios of identified popular tags and the overall number of tagged questions.  
The study concludes with a recommendation to increase deep learning content.
